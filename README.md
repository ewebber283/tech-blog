# tech-blog

Overview

The tech blog is a place where you can post blogs about tech. When you hit the login button, you will be directed to a page where you can either login or sign up. Once that is done, you will be taken to the home page where you will be able to go to your dashboard, comment on posts or logout. Once on your dashboard, you can post, edit your posts, delete your posts, or logout. 

Future Fixes

The styling of the website can be cleaner. The biggest issue that needs to be fixed is the ability to edit posts, as you can currently delete posts but cannot edit. The comment section of the first test post does not work either and keeps erroring out. There is an issue with clicking on blogs and when you create a blog post you add a link and the test links do not lead anywhere. 

Heroku Issues:
While everything runs smoothly when running using npm start. Heroku keeps erroring out. When deplouying it says the build is successul and my heroku dashboard has no issues displayed yet the app still is erroring out.
